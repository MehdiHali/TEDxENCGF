TEDxENCGF is an ENCG event started for the first time in the history of the school by students, for students. It is a new journey of education for the profit of their peers. A group of passionate students has reunited and are in charge of planning and organizing an event in the name of their school: The National School of Commerce and Management of Fes (ENCGF). This huge event will be impactful not just locally, but nationally thanks to the quality of our guest speakers who will be sharing their passions within this year’s theme. This event will surely be home to meaningful conversations and insights for all attendees.

              <p>Life lessons are present everywhere, in everyone's ideas and stories, to learn is simply to look and listen to others. We are here to spread ideas worth sharing and educate our community in regard to the most important aspects for them to succeed.</p>

              <p>Knowing what is right and doing what is required to make it a reality are two entirely different things; as Mahatma Gandhi once said: “Be the change you want to see in the world”. Taking action for the benefit of yourself and the people around you is crucial to making an impact.</p>

            <p>Spreading seeds grows the woods, to inspire the good is to share good thoughts, one hand won’t clap, together we could make the world a better place. Let your actions inspire others</p>

          <p class="text-center">About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

            <p class="text-center">TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.</p>
